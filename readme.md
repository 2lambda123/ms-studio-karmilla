**Karmilla** is a slightly modified version of **Karla**. 

Karla is an outstanding grotesque sans serif 
typeface family created by Jonathan Pinhorn ([@jonpinhorn_type](http://twitter.com/jonpinhorn_type), a graduate of the MA in Typeface Design at the University of Reading), released through Google Webfonts in 2012.

The aim of Karmilla is to offer a workaround for designers who want to use Karla on a French language website, which requires adding and tweaking some glyphs.

The original Karla font can be found here: http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Karla

The source files have been obtained from http://code.google.com/p/googlefontdirectory/ 

We are working in FontForge, so we are using the provided SFD files (maybe not optimal, as it seems the font was originally developed in FontLab?).

## Changes:

The changes we made so far:

* added å for Scandinavian languages.
* added ç (cedilla) character for better French support.
* added œ (ligatured o and e) character for better French support.
* the q character has been streamlined.
* the position of the typographic apostrophe has been changed, so it matches the height of ascenders (l', d').
