**Karmilla** is a slightly modified version of **Karla**. 

Karla is a very beautiful Unicode grotesque sans serif 
typeface family created by Jonathan Pinhorn (@jonpinhorn_type), relased through Google Webfonts in 2012.

The original Karla font can be found here: http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Karla

The source files have been obtained from http://code.google.com/p/googlefontdirectory/ 

We are working in FontForge, so we are using the SFD files (maybe not optimal, as it seems the font was developed in FontLab?)

## Changes:
The changes we one so far:

* added รง (cedil) character for better French support.
* added ล character for better French support.
* the q character has been streamlined.
* the position of the typographic apostrophe has been changed, so it matches the height of ascenders (l', d').
