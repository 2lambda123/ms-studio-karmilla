**Karmilla** is a slightly modified version of **Karla**. 

Karla is a very beautiful Unicode grotesque sans serif 
typeface family created by Jonathan Pinhorn (@jonpinhorn_type), relased through Google Webfonts in 2012.

The aim of Karmilla is to optimize Karla for the support of the French language, which requires adding and tweaking some glyphs.

The original Karla font can be found here: http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Karla

The source files have been obtained from http://code.google.com/p/googlefontdirectory/ 

We are working in FontForge, so we are using the SFD files (maybe not optimal, as it seems the font was developed in FontLab?)

## Changes:
The changes we one so far:

* added รง (cedilla) character for better French support.
* added ล (ligatured o and e) character for better French support.
* the q character has been streamlined.
* the position of the typographic apostrophe has been changed, so it matches the height of ascenders (l', d').
