FONTLOG for the Karmilla font

This file provides detailed information on Karmilla Font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the Karmilla 
font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Karmilla is a modified version of Karla, a Unicode grotesque sans serif 
typeface family that supports languages that use the Latin script and 
the Tamil script. This is the Latin script subset of the family.

The aim of Karmilla is to optimize Karla for the support of the French
language, which requires adding and modifiying some glyphs.
