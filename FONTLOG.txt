FONTLOG for the Karmilla font

This file provides detailed information on Karmilla Font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the Karmilla 
font and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Karmilla is a modified version of Karla, a Unicode grotesque sans serif 
typeface family that supports languages that use the Latin script and 
the Tamil script. This is the Latin script subset of the family.

The aim of Karmilla is to optimize Karla for the support of the French
language, which requires adding and modifiying some glyphs.

16 April 2014 (nclm) Karmilla v.011

22 April 2013 (ms-studio) Karmilla v.009
- Fixed a naming bug, improved rendering of accented characters on high-resolution (retina) devices.

12 October 2012 (ms-studio) Karmilla v.008
- Added slavic š, ć and ž in order to accomodate Greyscale Press website. Used existing Karla diacritics (turning the ^ upside down).

7 October 2012 (ms-studio) Karmilla v.007
- Inspired by a tweet from Olov Källgarn (@mc68ec040), I started adding å, æ and ø for Scandinavian languages.

28 September 2012 (ms-studio) Karmilla v.006
- Still not convinced by the cedilla. Copy-pasted the cedilla from Arimo (Regular and Bold),
a clean sans-serif font by Steve Matteson. I think this one works fine with Karla.

11 September 2012 (ms-studio) Karmilla v.005
- Not convinced by the hand drawn cedilla. Copy-pasted the cedilla from Inconsolata 
(Regular and Bold), a beautiful monospaced font by Raph Levien.

- Added a hand drawn ç (cedilla) to Regular (U+00E7)
- Added œ (ligature of o and e) to Regular (U+0153)
- Streamlined the q character.
- Changed the position of apostrophe (aligned on l) (U+2019)
